## [acoustic_lavitation] basics

### Limitations
* How large the particle can be?
  1. Smaller than "half-wavelength" (wavelength of 40kHz in air is 8.6mm) --> less than 4mm
  2. it is easier to go smaller, ie. trap cells in water
* How heavy the particles can be?
  1. Depends on the acoustic power. It is easy to levitate objects of 1.1g/cm3 and even up to 8 g/cm3
* What materials are supported?
  1. Anything with enough acoustic contract from the medium:
    - plastics
    - liquids
    - food
    - small insects
    - heavy gasses
  2. the propagation medium can be air but also water or tissue

### Applications
  * Chemical reactions are speeded up (catalysed). Lab-on-a-droplet
  * Microorganisms change behaviour: Some bacteria are 3 times more aggressive in micro-gravity
  * Hydroponic levitated seed: is it equivalent to grow plants in the international space station?



### Notes
>  As resonance and constructive interference starts to come into play given the scale we are able to produce PCBs it may be entirely possible to etch a fine structured board with multiple coils combining their power to focus just above the surface to get them on par with transducers or even more powerful. Using a similar setup as Photon Sieves except for sound manipulation of the wave front such that it focuses all the "Speakers" onto a point like a parabola would should be entirely doable.
