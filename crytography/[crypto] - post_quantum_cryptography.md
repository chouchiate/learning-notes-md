## [crypto] - Shor's Algorithm

### Post Quantum Cryptography

* Almost All Network Transactions Are Encrypted

### Quantum Computing (Shor’s Algorithm) Breaks Cryptosystems
* RSA, ECC (Elliptic Curve Cryptography, including ECDSA) . . . all broken
* RSA, ECC (Elliptic Curve Cryptography, including ECDSA) etc.
* RSA depends on Factoring
* ECC depends on Discrete Logarithms on Elliptic Curve Groups

### Quantum Computers Don’t Solve All Hard Problems
* Decoding a Random (error-correcting) Code
* Solving a Multivariate Quadratic (MQ) system of equations
* Find Short Vectors in Lattices, Inverting One-Way Functions in Symmetric Crypto

### Cryptosystems Surviving Quantum Computing are PostQuantum
* McEliece (Codes), NTRU, LPR (Lattices), Unbalanced-Oil-and-Vinegar (MQ), etc

### NSA on Quantum Key Distribution (QKD)
#### Technical limitations
* QKD requires special purpose equipment (not just any computer).
* QKD increases infrastructure costs and insider threat risks.
* QKD poses a significant challenge to secure and validate.
* QKD increases the risk of denial of service.
* QKD is only a partial solution.
    - I provide no authentication, actually needs an authenticated channel
    - F in modern crypto, authentication ⇔ can exchange keys ⇔ do secure communications.
