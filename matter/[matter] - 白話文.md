### What is Matter
> Matter makes it easier for device manufacturers to build devices that are compatible with smart home and voice services such as Amazon’s Alexa, Apple’s Siri, Google’s Assistant, and others. The first specification release of the Matter protocol will run on [Wi-Fi](https://www.wi-fi.org/) and [Thread](https://www.threadgroup.org/) network layers and will use [Bluetooth Low Energy](https://www.bluetooth.com/) for commissioning.
