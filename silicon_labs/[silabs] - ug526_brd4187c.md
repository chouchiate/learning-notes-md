### Si7021 Relative Humidity and Temperature Sensor
* factory-calibrated and the calibration data is stored in the on-chip non-volatile memory.
* This ensures that the sensors are fully interchangeable with no recalibration or software changes required.
* Si7021 offers an accurate, low-power, factory-calibrated digital solution ideal for measuring humidity, dew point, and temperature in
applications ranging from HVAC/R and asset tracking to industrial and consumer platforms.
* SENSOR_ENABLE (PD03) must be set high
* When enabled, the sensor's current consumption is included in the AEM
