## [TS] - **SOLID Principle學習筆記**

> SOLID is an acronym for the first five object-oriented design(OOD) principles by Robert C. Martin, popularly known as @UncleBob.

The five SOLID principles are:

* ***Single responsibility principle***: 
  - a class should have one, and only one, reason to change;
* ***Open-closed principle***: 
  - it should be possible to extend the behavoir of a class without  modifying it;
* ***Liskov Substitution principle***: 
  - subclasses should be substitutable for their superclasses;
* ***Interface segregation principle***: 
  - many small, client-specific interfaces are better than one general purpose interface;
* ***Dependency inversion principle***: 
  - depends on abstractions not concretions;
